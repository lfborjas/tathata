#Tathata

[Tathat훮/Dharmat훮](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tathat훮/Dharmat훮):
observe the suchness of your life.

The title is kinda ironic because this lets you be aware of your
proceedings (expenses, incomes, feelings); which could be argued goes
against Zen since the whole point of Zen is to let the natural mind be
and not strive to be self aware. But if someone argues that I'll tell
them that _they_ are dwelling too much in labels and concepts and we'll
all disappear in a puff of logic. Logic, the veil of maya.

Whatever Zen lies behind the name, I was just really itching to play
around with [Meteor JS](http://meteor.com) instead of doing actual work.

It's 5:00 a.m., your argument is invalid.
